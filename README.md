> If you don't use interfaces in your code, you may face the following challenges:
> - Tight Coupling: Your code may become tightly coupled, making it harder to change or maintain.  
> - Lack of Abstraction: Without interfaces, it becomes difficult to abstract away the implementation details of a type.  
> - Reduced Reusability: Code that doesn't use interfaces is harder to reuse and is more prone to breaking when changes are made.   
> - Harder to Test: Code that is tightly coupled and doesn't use interfaces is harder to test because it's difficult to mock or stub dependencies.  
> - Harder to Extend: Without interfaces, it becomes harder to extend the behavior of a type without modifying its implementation.  
>  
> By using interfaces, you can mitigate these challenges, making your code more flexible, maintainable, and easier to test.
